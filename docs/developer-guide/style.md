Style Guide
===========

The goal of the style guide is to describe in detail naming conventions
for developing DiTTo.

Naming Conventions
------------------

1) All functions and methods should be lower case with use of underscores for clarity

```python
def parse_data(): pass
```

2) All classes should be `PascalCase`

```python
class GridLABDReader(AbstractReader):
    pass
```
