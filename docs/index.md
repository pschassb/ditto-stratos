DiTTo is a _Distribution Transformation Tool_ that aims at providing an open source framework to convert various distribution systems modeling formats.
DiTTo implements a _many-to-one-to-many_ parsing framework which makes it modular and robust.
Readers and writers are then implemented to perform the translation from a given format to the core representation, or the other way around.
