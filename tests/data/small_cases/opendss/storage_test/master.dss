New Circuit.Name Bus1=97 pu=1.0 basekV=12.47

! Defining the storage unit at bus 98
New Storage.N98 Bus1=98 kV=4.16 kWRated=75 kWhRated=150 kWhStored=150
~ State=IDLING !(this is the default)
! Now set it to discharge at 25% rate
Storage.n98.state=Dischar %discharge=25
FormEdit "storage.n98" ! this will confirm the property changes
